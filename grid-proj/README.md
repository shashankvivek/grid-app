# GridProj

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.12.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## To Discuss:

1. Put some check to make sure Min and Max have keys in same order. or add a sorting based on Element name
2. Clarity on the range of min and max value. I have considered from 0 to 1.
